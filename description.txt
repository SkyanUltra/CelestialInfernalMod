Celestial Infernal Mod is a mod that adds:
 * At least five new bosses and many more enemies
 * 25+ new weapons
 * New tools
 * New accessories

Welcome to the overhaul! There are lots of new sprites and changes, and even a few new foes and quests. There are a few less-than-new sprites left, but they'll be 
changed someday. The mod isn't on the 1.0 version ( the full version ), so we will keep adding more stuff and editing its content for a better experience!
Please have a good day!
